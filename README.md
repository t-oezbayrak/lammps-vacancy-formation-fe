# lammps-vacancy-formation-fe
# Run was done to calculate vacancy formation energy in a BCC Fe crystal
# Creating a 10x10x10 box using ppp conditions and relaxing it taking the total energy and energy per atom
# Creating a vacancy and relaxing it and noting tthe total energy again
# Using the equation E_vac = E_defect - ((N-1) * E_per_atom)
# Resulted in 1.71 eV approximately
